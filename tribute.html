            <p>William Henry "Bill" Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software
                developer, and philanthropist. He is best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation. During his
                career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and
                chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He is one
                of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the personal computer revolution and the modern software
                industry, specifically in the microcomputer operating system market.</p>
            <p>In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company.
                During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect,
                and was the largest individual shareholder until May 2014. Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft
                in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology advisor to support the newly appointed CEO Satya
                Nadella.</p>
            <p>Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized
                for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion that has in some cases
                been upheld by the courts. In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of
                philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and
                scientific research programs through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, established in 2000.</p>
